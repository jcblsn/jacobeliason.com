    abstract = {Many surveys of the U.S. household population are experiencing higher refusal
                    rates. Nonresponse can, but need not, induce nonresponse bias in survey
                    estimates. Recent empirical findings illustrate cases when the linkage between
                    nonresponse rates and nonresponse biases is absent. Despite this, professional
                    standards continue to urge high response rates. Statistical expressions of
                    nonresponse bias can be translated into causal models to guide hypotheses about
                    when nonresponse causes bias. Alternative designs to measure nonresponse bias
                    exist, providing different but incomplete information about the nature of the
                    bias. A synthesis of research studies estimating nonresponse bias shows the bias
                    often present. A logical question at this moment in history is what advantage
                    probability sample surveys have if they suffer from high nonresponse rates.
                    Since postsurvey adjustment for nonresponse requires auxiliary variables, the
                    answer depends on the nature of the design and the quality of the auxiliary
                    variables.},

  author   = "Herzog, A R and Rodgers, W L",
  abstract = "The relationship between response rate--a basic indicator of the
              quality of survey data--and age is investigated. Standard
              definitions of general and age-specific response rates are
              presented first. In a systematic assessment of response rates by
              age, data from several large interview sample surveys and panel
              resurveys are then examined. Response rates are found to decline
              linearly with increasing age in both types of surveys, although
              the decline is not always statistically significant. Potential
              causes and consequences of low response rates among elderly
              persons are discussed.",
