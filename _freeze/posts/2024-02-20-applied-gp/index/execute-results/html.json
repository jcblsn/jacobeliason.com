Gaussian processes offer an elegant solution to this problem by assigning a probability to each of these functions*\n  - *The key idea of Gaussian processes is to model the underlying distribution of XX together with YY as a multivariate normal distribution*\n- What is a kernel?\n  - *The covariance between function values at any two points*\n\nhelpful visualizations [^1] [^2]\n\n[^1]: https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/\n[^2]: http://www.infinitecuriosity.org/vizgp/\n\n",
